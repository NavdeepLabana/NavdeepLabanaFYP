Final Year Project - (University)
This Python program aims to help illustrate how an organisation complies with GDPR; it uses the function of the questionnaire and scoring system, producing live charts as you continue to answer the questionnaire. As it continues and you finish answering the questions, you are then shown recommendations on how this can be improved with the function of producing all the charts and graphs shown on the dashboard onto a PDF file. Be sure to install the latest version of Python, pip, and all listed in requirements.txt.txt
